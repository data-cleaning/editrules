version 0.7-1
- made as.errormatrix a bit more robust and solved a cornercase 
- fixed bug in editmatrix causing crashes in cornercase when "description" column of input is empty.

version 0.7
- errorLocalizer gains searchBest() function, returns random solution in case of degeneracy
- added as.character coercions in editmatrix to solve crash
- BREAKING CHANGE: replaceValues renamed to substValues. Currently warns, will emit error in next release.
- BREAKING CHANGE: cp.editmatrix renamed to errorLocalizer and now S3 generic. Currently warns, will emit error in next release.
- getC and getMatrix are deprecated and now emit errors.
- Vignette ready for review
- solved bug in documentation of cp.editmatrix
- solved bug in str.editmatrix
- isObviouslyRedundant now finds duplicate rows within tolerance.
- overloaded built-in function "duplicated" for editmatrix. 
- Added full feasibility check for editmatrix: isFeasible
- removed bug from findBlocks and exported.

version 0.6
- Edit rule coercions: as.expression as.character as.editmatrix as.data.frame
- Transform equality restrictions to reduced row echelon form
- Obvious (in)feasibility and redundancy checks for linear edit rules
- The following functions are deprecated, and give a warning: getC, getMatrix (warnings will become errors in the next release).
- Added cp.editmatrix which solves error localization under generalized Fellegi-Holt paradigm
- Added choicepoint algorithm for generic binary search
- Option normalize=TRUE for editmatrix is now the default
- Overloaded str function for editmatrix object
- Added fully vectorized Fourier-Motzkin elimination function with redundancy removal
- Added a normalize function
- Exported and documented replaceValue
- rewrote internal representation of editmatrix, it is now an augemented matrix (A|b)
- BREAKING CHANGE: clean up of notation/syntax/naming convention: constants are named b, coefficients are named A

version 0.5
- fixed breakage at single record input of violatedEdits
- added findBlocks, break up a matrix in its constituing blocks

version 0.4-1
- long edit rules (> 60 characters) failed, the upper limit for editrules is right now 500
- added row subscript operator for object of class editmatrix
- added getMatrix, same functionality as as.matrix, but more symetric with respect to getOps, getC and getVars

version 0.4
- improved expression parsing
- improved handling of wrong input for method editmatrix
- improved handling of extra columns in editrules
- added as.data.frame.editmatrix
- negative coefficients and constants were not parsed correctly
- added vignette
- removed deprecated editsinfo parameter from editmatrix
- added getOps and getCONSTANT functions for retrieving operators and constants from an editmatrix
- checkRows is now S3 generic and overloaded for character, data.frame and editmatrix
- added simplification of constraints (coefficients will be summed)
- renamed errormatrix into violatedEdits

version 0.2
- added CONSTANT parsing and generation
- simplified editmatrix by removing one parameter (accepting both types of input)
- renamed editsinfo to more understandable editrules
- removed documentation of internal "edits" function

version 0.1-1
- added an as.matrix function
- improved editmatrix example
