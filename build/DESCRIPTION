Title: R package for parsing and manipulating edit rules
LazyData: no
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Edwin de Jonge, Mark van der Loo
Description: Facilitates reading and manipulation of categorical and
    linear (in)equality constraints on data (edit rules). Numerical 
    edits are converted to matrix format from text, and categorical rules
    are converted to a boolean format. Data may be tested against the rules
    and erroneous fields can be localized based on Fellegi and Holt's 
    generalized principle. Edits may be manipulated and tested for consistency
    by means of variable (Fourier-Motzkin) elimination or substitution.
